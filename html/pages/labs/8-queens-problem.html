			<p class="page-introduction">
				The 8 Queens Problem is a mathematical problem requiring the solver to place 8 queens on a chess board in such a way that no queen threatens another. It was originally published in 1858 and has since been extended as the n-Queens problem - the problem of placing n-queens on a chess board of n x n squares.

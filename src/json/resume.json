				"Although my training lies primarily in Java development, I consider myself a fullstack developer and am just as comfortable creating a new screen with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I am querying a database. With a background in Spring and Hibernate I am able to create richly functioning websites.",

Having worked in environments utilising the Agile methodology I relish the discussions and processes that go into the scoping of development tasks and projects. I thrive on tasks that challenge me and prefer to work on things that are complex - there is no feeling better than getting a well-written piece of code to function correctly."
